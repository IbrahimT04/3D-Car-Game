## Introduction

The **3D Car Game** is a simple 3D racing game under development. The game is written in C++ and focuses on providing an engaging gameplay experience with basic car physics, 3D rendering, and player controls.

This project aims to develop a fun and interactive game environment where users can control a car and navigate through a 3D world.

## Features

- **Basic 3D Rendering:** Display the game environment and car in a 3D space.
- **Player Controls:** Use keyboard controls to navigate and control the car.
- **Physics Simulation:** Basic car movement and physics to simulate real-world driving behavior.
- **Customizable Game Elements:** (In future updates) Add new levels, vehicles, or game environments.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IbrahimT04/3D-Car-Game.git
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**

   Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio). Navigate to the project directory and compile the code:

   ```bash
   cd 3D-Car-Game
   g++ -o 3DCarGame main.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the Game:**

   ```bash
   ./3DCarGame
   ```

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys:** Control car movement (Forward, Backward, Left, Right).
- **Spacebar:** Apply brakes.
- **ESC:** Quit the game.

## How to Play

Once the game starts, the player controls a car in a 3D environment. Use the arrow keys to navigate the car, avoiding obstacles and staying on track. The goal is to reach the finish line as fast as possible.

### Future Improvements:
- Add collision detection.
- Implement score tracking and time records.
- Expand game with multiple levels and challenges.
